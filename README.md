Project Workflow
The following is a fundamental outline of the project:

This analysis aims to investigate the presence of skewness and outliers within the dataset.
The data will be converted into a format that is appropriate for analysis, and any required cleaning and pre-processing procedures will be carried out.
The objective of this study is to construct a machine learning regression model that utilizes the decision tree regressor to accurately forecast the continuous variable 'Selling_Price'.
The objective of this study is to construct a machine learning classification model using the decision tree classifier to accurately predict the outcome of a given task, namely whether it will result in a "WON" or "LOST" status.
The objective is to develop a Streamlit webpage that enables users to input values for each column and get the expected Selling_Price value or determine the Status (Won/Lost).
